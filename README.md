# Django-Tutorial-SourceCode

## Source code for the Django tutorials

#### I. Firs Project:
  Intall Django, create a project and an application in the project.
  Create a view and mapping it to a URL.
  Connect templates with models so you can display data created dynamically.
  Insert static media files.

#### II. Level Two:
  Models in Models-Views-Templates (MVT pattern).

  In the settings.py file, edit the ENGINE parameter used for DATABASES.

  To create an actual model, we use a class structure inside of the relevant applications models.py file.

  Use the Faker library to create this script that will populate your models with some “dummy” data.
  
#### III. Level Three:
  Use Django Forms to accept User Input and connect it to the database and retrieve it later on.

  The Django framework requires the CSRF token to be present.
  
  Use Django Forms to grab information from the user and then do something with it.
